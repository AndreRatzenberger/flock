# Create TOML Serialization Documentation and Examples

## Summary

Create comprehensive documentation and examples for the TOML serialization feature.

## Description

This task involves creating documentation, examples, and tutorials to help users understand and utilize the new TOML serialization capabilities for Flock agents and systems. Clear documentation with examples is essential for adoption of this feature, as it represents a new way to configure and share agent definitions.

## User Story

[US007-TOML-Serialization](.project/userstories/US007-TOML-Serialization.md)

## Technical Requirements

1. Create documentation on TOML serialization for both FlockAgent and Flock classes
2. Provide detailed examples of TOML formats for different agent types
3. Create tutorials on how to manually create and edit TOML agent definitions
4. Document the callable reference system and how to use it
5. Update existing documentation to include TOML as a serialization option
6. Add example files in the examples directory

## Test Requirements

The following verification steps should be implemented to ensure documentation quality:

1. **Documentation Completeness Tests**:
   - Verify all TOML-related methods are documented with correct signatures
   - Check that all parameters are explained with appropriate types
   - Ensure return values and exceptions are documented
   - Verify documentation covers all edge cases and special considerations

2. **Example Correctness Tests**:
   - Run all provided TOML examples to verify they work as documented
   - Verify examples cover a range of complexity levels (basic to advanced)
   - Ensure examples demonstrate all major features of the TOML serialization
   - Test that code snippets in documentation match actual implementation

3. **Tutorial Validation Tests**:
   - Follow each tutorial step-by-step to verify accuracy
   - Check that tutorials address common use cases
   - Verify tutorials explain the "why" behind recommended practices
   - Ensure tutorials include troubleshooting guidance

4. **Reference Documentation Tests**:
   - Verify the callable reference system is clearly explained
   - Check that all reference formats are documented with examples
   - Ensure registry system documentation is complete
   - Test that advanced reference cases are covered

5. **Documentation Integration Tests**:
   - Verify links between documentation sections work correctly
   - Check that TOML documentation is integrated with existing docs
   - Ensure TOML is presented as a first-class feature alongside JSON
   - Test that navigation between related concepts is intuitive

6. **Example File Tests**:
   - Verify example files can be run without modification
   - Check that example files contain appropriate comments
   - Ensure examples demonstrate practical use cases
   - Test examples with both local and distributed execution

All documentation should be reviewed for clarity, completeness, and technical accuracy. User feedback should be solicited to identify any confusing or unclear sections.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create documentation sections:
   - Overview of TOML serialization feature
   - API reference for new TOML methods
   - Format specification for agent TOML files
   - Format specification for Flock system TOML files
   - Guide to the callable reference system
2. Create examples:
   - Simple agent in TOML format
   - Agent with tools in TOML format
   - Agent with modules in TOML format
   - Multi-agent system in TOML format
3. Create tutorials:
   - How to convert existing JSON agents to TOML
   - How to create agents manually in TOML
   - How to customize agent definitions in TOML
4. Add example files:
   - Create example TOML files in the examples directory
   - Add a specific example demonstrating TOML serialization
5. Update README and other documentation to include TOML options

## Definition of Done

1. Comprehensive documentation is created for all TOML serialization features
2. Multiple examples demonstrate different use cases
3. Tutorials show how to use the feature effectively
4. Example files are added to the examples directory
5. Existing documentation is updated to include TOML
6. Documentation is reviewed for clarity and completeness
