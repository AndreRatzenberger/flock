# Settings Editor UI Components

## Summary
Design and implement the user interface components for the environment settings editor in the Flock CLI.

## Description
This task focuses on creating a well-designed, intuitive UI for the settings editor using Rich and Questionary. The UI should make it easy for users to navigate through settings, understand what they're editing, and get visual feedback on their actions.

## Technical Requirements
- Create a consistent visual layout for the settings editor
- Implement color coding for different types of environment variables (secrets, URLs, paths, etc.)
- Design navigation elements for moving through settings
- Create input components for editing values with appropriate validation
- Implement status messages and confirmation dialogs
- Ensure the UI is responsive and works well in different terminal sizes
- Provide visual cues for required vs optional settings

## Implementation Plan
1. Design the main settings list view with pagination
2. Create a settings detail/edit view
3. Design confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
4. Implement status/feedback messages
5. Create a help/legend component to explain UI elements
6. Design the "add new setting" form
7. Ensure consistent styling across all components

## Definition of Done
- All UI components render correctly in different terminal environments
- Navigation is intuitive and efficient
- Visual feedback is clear and helpful
- Layout adapts to different terminal sizes
- Consistent styling throughout the application
- Input validation provides clear error messages

## Dependencies
