# Implement TOML Serialization for FlockAgent

## Summary
Add TOML serialization and deserialization support for FlockAgent classes.

## Description
This task involves extending the FlockAgent class with methods to save and load agent configurations in TOML format. The TOML format will provide a more human-readable and editable alternative to the existing JSON serialization, making it easier for developers to create and modify agent definitions manually.

## User Story
[US007-TOML-Serialization](.project/userstories/US007-TOML-Serialization.md)

## Technical Requirements
1. Add methods to the FlockAgent class:
   - `save_to_toml_file()`: Save agent to a TOML file
   - `load_from_toml_file()`: Load agent from a TOML file
2. Create a human-readable representation of agent properties in TOML
3. Handle special cases like callables (functions, methods) through a reference system
4. Create a serialization format that preserves all agent functionality
5. Include helpful comments in the generated TOML files

## Implementation Plan
1. Extend the FlockAgent class with TOML serialization methods:
   - Implement `save_to_toml_file(file_path: str)` method
   - Implement `load_from_toml_file(cls, file_path: str)` class method
2. Create a strategy for handling callable objects in TOML:
   - For built-in tools, use named references
   - For custom functions, either pickle them or store a reference to their location
3. Add documentation in the form of comments to the generated TOML
4. Add appropriate file extension handling (`.toml`)
5. Create a test case that verifies:
   - An agent can be saved to TOML
   - The TOML file is human-readable
   - The agent can be loaded back from TOML with identical functionality
6. Update docstrings and examples

## Definition of Done
1. FlockAgent can be saved to a TOML file with a clear, human-readable format
2. FlockAgent can be loaded from a TOML file with all functionality preserved
3. Generated TOML files include helpful comments
4. All edge cases (tools, modules, evaluators) are handled correctly
5. Unit tests verify the serialization cycle works correctly
6. Documentation is updated with TOML examples

## Dependencies
- [US007-T001-TOML-Serializable-Base](.project/tasks/US007-T001-TOML-Serializable-Base.md) should be completed first
