### TOML Serialization for Agents and Flock Systems

This feature adds support for serializing and deserializing agents and complete Flock systems to TOML format, providing a more human-readable alternative to the existing JSON serialization.

## Completed Tasks

### Environment Settings Editor

The settings editor is a key feature of the Flock CLI that allows users to view, edit, add, and delete environment variables in the `.env` file.

#### Implementation Tasks

| ID | Task | Priority | Status | Description |
|----|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| US001-001 | [Settings Editor Implementation](tasks/done/US001-001-env-settings-editor.md) | High | Completed | Implement the core settings editor functionality |
| US001-002 | [Settings Editor UI Components](tasks/done/US001-002-env-settings-ui-components.md) | High | Completed | Design and implement UI components for the settings editor |
| US001-003 | [Environment File Operations](tasks/done/US001-003-env-settings-file-operations.md) | High | Completed | Implement robust file operations for the .env file |
| US001-004 | [Settings Security Features](tasks/done/US001-004-settings-security-features.md) | High | Completed | Implement security features for protecting sensitive information |
| US001-005 | [Environment Profile Switching](tasks/done/US001-005-env-profile-switching.md) | High | Completed | Implement feature to switch between multiple environment profiles (.env configurations) |

#### Implementation Approach

The settings editor was implemented in stages:

1. **Core Functionality**: Parse and manipulate .env files, implement the main settings editor menu
2. **UI Components**: Create a user-friendly interface with proper formatting and navigation
3. **File Operations**: Ensure robust reading and writing of .env files with proper error handling
4. **Security Features**: Add protection for sensitive information like API keys and tokens
5. **Profile Management**: Implement ability to create and switch between different environment profiles

#### Definition of Done

The implementation is considered complete as:

- Users can access the settings editor from the main CLI menu
- All core functionality (view, edit, add, delete) works correctly
- Users can switch between different environment profiles (dev, test, prod)
- The UI is intuitive and provides clear feedback
- File operations are robust and prevent data loss
- Sensitive information is properly protected
- Code is well-documented and follows project conventions

## Next Steps

After completing the settings editor, potential future enhancements could include:

- Settings groups/categories for better organization
- Import/export functionality for settings
- Presets for common configurations
- Integration with cloud-based secrets management
- Command history and autocomplete features
